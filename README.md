# 💡Project Description:
The Person Detection System leverages the capabilities of the Arduino Nano BLE 33 to detect and identify the presence of a person in its vicinity. This compact, power-efficient system utilizes advanced sensors and machine learning models to provide reliable and real-time person detection, making it ideal for applications such as security systems, smart homes, or robotics.

📸📷Key Features:
Core Board:

🖥️ The Arduino Nano BLE 33 serves as the core processing unit, offering BLE capabilities for wireless communication and the processing power needed for edge AI.
Sensors:

Built-in 9-axis IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for detecting movement.
External PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor or camera module for detecting the presence of a person.
Machine Learning Integration:

Pre-trained TinyML (TensorFlow Lite) models are deployed on the board for recognizing the presence of a person using camera or motion data.
Communication:

The system can transmit detection alerts via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a smartphone or connected device.
Power Efficiency:

Designed to run on a low-power setup, making it suitable for battery-operated environments.
How It Works:
The system continuously monitors its environment using sensors (e.g., PIR or camera module).

Data from the sensors is processed by the onboard AI model to detect the presence of a person.

🧍🏿👩🏼‍🦽 Upon detecting a person:

An alert is sent to a connected smartphone or computer via BLE.
Optionally, an onboard LED or buzzer can be triggered to indicate detection locally.
The device can also log detection events for later analysis.

🔥 Applications:
Security: Detect intruders in restricted areas.
Smart Homes: Enable automation based on human presence.
Robotics: Enhance human-robot interaction by recognizing people in the vicinity.
Health Monitoring: Detect the presence of caregivers or patients.
🎗️ Why Arduino Nano BLE 33?
